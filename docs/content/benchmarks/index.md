Light-Java framework is the fastest so far on the market and there are a lot of effort to make that happen.
There are a lot of frameworks, languages to build microservices but most popular ones are Java, Go and Nodejs.

Nodejs used to be really fast compare with JavaEE platforms but it has a lot of 
[issues](https://networknt.github.io/light-java/benchmarks/nodejs/) in enterprise world. Go has potentials but
still not in enterprise applications. We are starting with Java due to the fact that it is highly optimized
and there are so many existing investment in all sorts of organizations.

We have tested most of microservices frameworks and here is the 
[benchmarks](https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example/tree/master/performance) along with source code.
