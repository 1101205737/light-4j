title: Development Flow
---

There are three flows running in parallel but not started at the same time.

API Specification starts the first and it will be done by data architect and business
analyst.

API Development starts when the first release of the specification is done by API 
developers.

Client Development starts almost the same time as API Development team as mock API can
be generated from swagger specification immediately.

During the process, specification might be changed and the changes will be propagated
to API development team and Client development team(s).
