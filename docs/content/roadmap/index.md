The REST API framework is used by one of the big banks in Canada and is in a process to be production
ready. 

The short term goal is to make sure the API framework is production ready.

The mid term goal is to support GraphQL in the framework and make undertow-oauth2 server production ready.

The long term goal is to build an API portal so that all APIs can be managed by the portal/marketplace.
