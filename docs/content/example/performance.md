# Introduction

This is a example to compare performance between Spring Boot and Light Java framework. It can be found [here](https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example/tree/master/performance)
with the testing result on my desktop.

The light-java implementation is much simpler and faster(44 times faster) then Spring Boot which is the most popular API/microservices platform at the moment.
