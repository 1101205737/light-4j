## Code Generation

The easiest way to start your REST API project is from OpenAPI specification and here 
is a video to show you how to generate a project from swagger spec.

## Start from one of the example project

You can find many example projects at a separate repo [light-java-example](https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example)
and start by copying one of them.

## Building microservices? 

Follow the [microservices tutorial](https://networknt.github.io/light-java/tutorials/microservices/) 
to build multiple services that communicate each other. The source code for the tutorial
can be found at [https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example](https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example)

* api_a is calling api_b and api_c
* api_b is calling api_d
* api_c is an independent service
* api_d is an independent service
